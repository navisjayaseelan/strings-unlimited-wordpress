                            How does your company manage risk in business transactions?

                        <p>
                            We consciously promote risk free transactions to all our partners. This is part of our company values of being transparent with all our business partners. As much as we avoid taking risks in our business transactions we believe that our partners also should not in any way put in risk by working with us. Hence we have a policy of taking advance payment or arrange a sight LC (International Clients) to initiate the production process. Balance payments are either agreed to be paid on delivery of goods or maximum 7 business days from date of delivery of goods provided we are given a post-dated cheque by your company as a guarantee. Please refer to our T&C document which clearly underlines the conditions that are related to Balance payment collection.
